# ReactJS CSS

Run the following command to get a basic ReactJS application setup for CSS:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm install react-transition-group styled-components --save
yarn start
```


1. Add inline styling to elements in the my-app/src/App.js

2. Add className to at least one element in the my-app/src/App.js

3. Use the ReactTransitionGroup CSSTransition to trigger content to be animated in and out of the page when a button is clicked.

4. Use the styled-components keyframes to cause div to expand like an overlay on the page.

5. Add another button and have it trigger different styles for the button based upon if it has been clicked or not.

6. Add LESS functionality to your application.

Hint: You will need to run the following command to expose the configuration files for the project:

```
npm run eject
```

7. Replace the LESS functionality with SASS to your application.


After you have completed all of the exercises, commit your changes with the following command:

```
git commit -am "ReactJS CSS Examples"
```
